Analytics and visualization toolkit to aid Exploratory Data Analysis

This is a set of useful components to support a visualization dashboard, which will be used to aid any analysts in their data exploration work. 

Contributors should choose one of the following to work on:

1) **Google Keep like note taking app** as a Google chrome extension (must work on chrome v52)

2) **Query builder** for inputting search criteria to pull subset of data for exploration

3) **In-app Instant Messaging** for discussing analysis work

4) **Cross-filter** support for data drilling in other components

Requirements
-------------

- No cloud services (eg google bigquery) should be used in the solutioning as it will be offline. Use of nosql technologies such as mongodb and /or redis is allowed.  These components should be containerized using docker for easy packaging if they are used in the solutioning.

- Components should be built using chrome plugin or react.js

- React components should be well designed, extensible, and reusable. 

- Javascript and react code must conform to airbnb's coding style guide for ES6 and React component. Check will be perform via eslint

- Code should be properly source controlled using github
